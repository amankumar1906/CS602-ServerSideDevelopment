To switch to the ES6 module system, we will need to update our package.json and add the following line:
"type": "module"

Once this is done, all the "require" statements can be switched to "import" statements.
For example,
const Server = require("BTS_Army");
is changed to
import {Server} from "BTS_Army"; //This shall only work if there is an export statement for Server in BTS_Army module.

Upon changing all such required imports, we can run the file using `node app.js` and it shall run as expected.
